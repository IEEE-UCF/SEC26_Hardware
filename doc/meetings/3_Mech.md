# SECbot 4.1

## Mech Meeting 9/30 @ 5pm

Start time:

## Intro

### Recap last meeting

* Went over rules quickly
* Did some basic brainstorming
* Make sure that everyone who needs to has been added to the fusion team

### Last meeting's notes

- Crank
  
  - Wavy wheel

- Button
  
  - Should reuse the same mechanism for keypad task

- Keypad
  
  - 2DOF

- Rack and pinion

- Lead screw

- 3d printer?

- Pressure plate

- Duckies
  
  - Passive mechanism with rubber bands or compliant wheels go brr
  
  - Claw
    
    - Rubber?
  
  - Surgical tubing wheel

- Arm
  
  - Virutal 4bar whatever slop
  
  - Scara
  
  - Mostly horizontal arm scissor, slightly up

- Crater
  
  - Pick the external robot out of the crater

- Drone
  
  - Combine the drone and crater robot into one?

### New business

* Any new ideas
  
  * Scara arm, the same arm used for the duck could be used for the keypad
    
    * The arm is on a rotating joint
  
  * Other ideas go here

* Prototyping
  
  * Does not have to be "integration ready", just a feasability check
  
  * Should be competing design, people should work separately

* Drivetrain
  
  * Does the drivetrain need suspension (is it going to enter the crater?)
  
  * Write specifications for the drivetrain
  
  * Assign people to prototype

* Keypad task/arm
  
  * Assign people to prototype

* Duck intake
  
  * Assign people to prototype

* Add more subsections here if needed

### Conclude + Kick everyone out
