# Mechanical
10/8/25
Start time: 5:00

## Pre-meeting
* Sign QR code
* When2meet (forgot)

## Control Systems (20m)
* Discuss what a control system is (feedback loops, measuring vs target) 
* Examples: thermostat, cruise control, balancing a broom

## PID Breakdown (20m)
* P - proportional
* I - integral
* D - derivative

## Run workshop test node (5m)
* Branch: gazebo-harmonic-setup
* Deliverable for next meeting: make it work!
## List tasks for MCU, Assign (20m)
* Base classes
	* Motors, Servos, Subsystems, Inputs, Outputs
	* Maybe an even basier-class?
