# Thursday's Announcement

Hello <@member>, thank you for attending our Mechanical and Software meetings this week. Our next general meeting will be **Friday, 9/26, 5:00PM, MSB 306**

Here are the actionable items from our meetings:

### Mechanical:

* Install Fusion360 and activate licenses properly.

* Get familiar with common mechanisms. Look at VEX and FTC robot videos. <[Game Manual 0](https://gm0.org/en/latest/) 

### Software:

If you need help with any of these, ask your favorite LLM. DM <@syndric> if you're still stuck.

- Install Git Bash on windows, or Git on any other OS
- Install Docker Desktop
- Install Cloudflared
- Install Vscode
- Setup SSH keys for both Github and Gitea
- Add the proxy command to your SSH config file
- Clone the repo (you may lack permissions, please DM me)

If you still have time, take a look at the documents that Rafeed has sent above to get a feel for the software that we'll be creating for the robot this year.
