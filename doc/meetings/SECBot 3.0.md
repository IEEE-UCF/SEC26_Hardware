Hello <@member>, thank you for attending the second SECbot general meeting.

To recap, we went over past issues such as our **Jst Crimper**. There was no new business to introduce. Then, we nominated team leads for the **Mechanical, Electrical, and Drone Positions**. The outcomes are :

* Antonio - Mechanical

* Tino - Electrical

* Drone - Still open. We will renominate via same procedure next General meeting.

After, we went over the rules and had a brainstorming session.
